# Fire

`*The Reactive Programming Language*`

## Intro

Fire is a programming language based around the concepts of reactive programming, streams, and data processing. It's a highly portable, fast, and simple to learn language that lets you do anything with data. The linear, readable syntax is designed to be a modern programmer's best friend.

## Status

The first Fire development build is still in the works.

## Example

```
[1..5] -> (> 2) -> 
         + 5 -> print

result:
[8, 9, 10]
```
